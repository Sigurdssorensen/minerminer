Helmet Maintenance ~ The board wants to save money and proposed the following. Decreasing the maintenance cost on helmets will decrease our monthly costs ~ The monthly costs do not decrease ~ Due to bad helmets a worker has died ~ Nothing ~ Kill ~ Can possibly result in safer conditions ~ Can result in dangerous conditions due to malfunctioning equipment ~ 0 ~ 0 ~ 0 ~ 1
*
Possible gas pocket ~ The miners believe they have found a pocket of gas and are worried, they have asked for you permission to delay the mining activity in this zone until they can assure their safety. Depending on how long the investigations take not all contracts may be fulfilled and may result in one of your main clients leaving you ~ Due to an explosion a miner died and the contract was not fulfilled due to an entire zone collapsed ~ Due to careful investigation the pocket of gas was avoided, luckily the miners were motivated by your concern and they managed to fulfill all contracts ~ Kill ~ Nothing ~ Continuing will leave us vulnerable to accidents. ~ Staying away should ensure safety for our workers. ~ 0 ~ -2 ~ 2 ~ 1

New Policy To Prevent Accidents Due To Seismic Activity ~ Recent studies performed by your engineering team has red-flagged mine sector B as at risk if nearby seismic activity should occur. The Engineering team proposes that you allocate more resources to sector B in order to build a new foundation that can withstand these occurrences. ~ An earthquake made sector B collapse on itself with a worker trapped inside. ~ You were able to build the foundations in time, but lost some income due to a a lower production rate ~ Kill ~ Nothing ~ Not allocating resources can result in a collapse. ~ Allocating resources may prevent accidents, but will be costly. ~ 0 ~ 0 ~ -4 ~ 1
*
Air Quality ~ Workers are complaining that the air quality of some old sections make it unbearable to work in. We should consider upgrading the ventilation system, but it will not be cheap. ~ It turned out that the bad air was due to leaking gas, a worker died as a result of this. ~ The new ventilation system took a portion of money to install, but it seems like production has increased as a result of this. ~ Kill ~ Nothing ~ Leaving it be might be unhealthy to the workers. ~ Providing a new ventilation should settle down the workers. ~ 0 ~ 0 ~ -4 ~ 2
*
Work in Pairs ~ The miners are complaining about that some workers have to work alone in dangerous areas, and wants there to be a rule that there should be a minimum of two workers together at any given time. ~ A worker was found dead after he had gone missing for two days in the mine. ~ The workers are pleased and their productivity has slightly increased. ~ Kill ~ Nothing ~ Accidents might happen. ~ No projected outcome. ~ 0 ~ 0 ~ 0 ~ 2
*
Mining Carts ~ Workers suggest that you approve the use of mining carts for transportation of workers from and to shifts. ~ The workers are not happy with your decision. ~ A worker tilted the wagon and died. ~ Nothing ~ Kill ~ Its safer to walk. ~ Its may be dangerous, but its a lot faster. ~ 0 ~ 0 ~ 0 ~ 1
*
Old Explosives Have Been Found ~ The miners have found some old explosives in an older part of the mine, they are unsure if they are safe yo use and want your approval ~ You made sure that the explosives were not used, although it ensures their safety it means that you did not save any money this month ~ You let the miners use the explosives, they were very unstable and caused a major accident ~ Nothing ~ Kill ~ Using the explosives may be dangerous, better safe then sorry ~ Using the explosives may be dangerous, but it's worth the risk ~ 0 ~ 0 ~ -1 ~ 0
*
Possible Gold Vein Found ~ Some experts the board have sent believe there is gold in Sector 14, to get to it you need to improve the use of a large amount of explosives. ~ You decided it was to dangerous, no gold was found but everyone is safe and sound ~ You approved the use of the large amount of explosives which destabelized the mine, killing one of the miners. But the gold was found and this months income has increased dramatically ~ Nothing ~ Kill ~ The gold may be tempting but maybe better play it safe ~ If there is gold it is our duty to make sure we find it, it's worth the risk ~ 0 ~ 0 ~ 8 ~ 0
*
Possible toxic dust in mine ~ The miners have found something they believe to be toxic dust and  have requested protective gear, this gear is expensive to buy and maintain ~ Due to them not having the equipment worker has died and the miners now refuse to work there even with protective gear, decreasing efficiency greatly ~ Even with the equipment a worker has died and the miners now refuse to work there, decreasing efficiency greatly ~ Kill ~ Kill ~ There is no proof the dust is toxic, there no point waisting money ~ Even if there is toxic dust the protective gear is no guarantee ~ 0 ~ -1 ~ -4 ~ 1
