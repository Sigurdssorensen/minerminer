Possible gas pocket ~ The miners believe they have found a pocket of gas and are worried, they have asked for you permission to delay the mining activity in this zone until they can assure their safety. Depending on how long the investigations take not all contracts may be fulfilled and may result in one of your main clients leaving you ~ Due to an explosion a miner died and the contract was not fulfilled due to an entire zone collapsed ~ Due to careful investigation the pocket of gas was avoided, luckily the miners were motivated by your concern and they managed to fulfill all contracts ~ Kill ~ Nothing ~ Continuing will leave us vulnerable to accidents. ~ Staying away should ensure safety for our workers. ~ 0 ~ -2 ~ 2 ~ 1

New Policy To Prevent Accidents Due To Seismic Activity ~ Recent studies performed by your engineering team has red-flagged mine sector B as at risk if nearby seismic activity should occur. The Engineering team proposes that you allocate more resources to sector B in order to build a new foundation that can withstand these occurrences. ~ An earthquake made sector B collapse on itself with a worker trapped inside. ~ You were able to build the foundations in time, but lost some income due to a a lower production rate ~ Kill ~ Nothing ~ Not allocating resources can result in a collapse. ~ Allocating resources may prevent accidents, but will be costly. ~ 0 ~ 0 ~ -4 ~ 1

Air Quality ~ Workers are complaining that the air quality of some old sections make it unbearable to work in. We should consider upgrading the ventilation system, but it will not be cheap. ~ It turned out that the bad air was due to leaking gas, a worker died as a result of this. ~ The new ventilation system took a portion of money to install, but it seems like production has increased as a result of this. ~ Kill ~ Nothing ~ Leaving it be might be unhealthy to the workers. ~ Providing a new ventilation should settle down the workers. ~ 0 ~ 0 ~ -4 ~ 2
